# PWA-Commits
A simple progressive web app. The app simply tracks the latest commits from a particular open source project. As a progressive web app, it should:
	- Work offline. A user should be able to view the latest commits without an internet connection
	- The app should load instantly on repeated visits     
	- Once the push notification button is turned on, the user should get a notification on the latest commits to the open source project     
	- Be installable( added to the homescreen)     
	- Have a web application manifest
